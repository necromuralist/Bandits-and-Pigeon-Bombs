In the context of Reinforcement Learning, /Exploration/ refers to determining the reward that an action will give in a certain situation while /Exploitation/ refers to taking the action that will produce the greatest reward. The explorer can be thought of as scientist who wants to gather as much data as possible to decide what the outcomes are for specific behaviors while the exploiter can be thought of as a business-person who wants to maximize the gain.

A /dilemma/ is a choice between undesirable options (/di/ means "two" and /lemma/ means "to take" (from the [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/dilemma][Online Etymology Dictionary]])) or an unsolvable problem. The /Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma/ refers to the fact that the more you explore the more certain you will be of the rewards for actions but that means that you are taking actions that you are fairly certain don't have the best rewards, while the more you exploit the more you are doing what you think is the best action but you don't actually know what the best action is. So doing only one or the other is not a workable solution (in most cases).
