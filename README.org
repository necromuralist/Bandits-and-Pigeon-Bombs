#+TITLE: Reinforcement Learning Notes

* What This Is
  I decided to study reinforcement learning again, and these are my notes (sort of). The built HTML is [[https://necromuralist.github.io/reinforcement-learning/][here]]. Most of the stuff will be rendered as blog posts, but I'm also adding some documentation for the code I'm using in =Documentation= dropdown in the navbar.
