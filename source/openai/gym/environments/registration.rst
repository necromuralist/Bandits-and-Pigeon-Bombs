Registration
============

This is the `registration module <https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/registration.py>`__.

.. module:: gym.envs.registration

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: autogenerated

   EnvSpec
   EnvRegistry

.. note:: When you call ``gym.make()`` you are actually calling ``EnvRegistry.make`` method. Unfortunately it doesn't have a docstring, but the only argument it takes is a string with the name of the environment you want to build.


``make``
--------

Since this is one of the things that gets called all the time I thought I'd make some notes for it. Within ``gym.envs.registration`` ``make`` is defined as a function.


.. code::

   registry = EnvRegistry()

   def register(id, **kwargs):
       return registry.register(id, **kwargs)
   
   def make(id):
       return registry.make(id)

Then in the ``gym.envs.__init__`` module, they are imported and the various environments are registered. This is the first call in the file, registering the 'Copy-v0' environment.

.. code::

   register(
       id='Copy-v0',
       entry_point='gym.envs.algorithmic:CopyEnv',
       max_episode_steps=200,
       reward_threshold=25.0,
   )

Then in the ``gym.__init__`` file they import ``make`` so that you can call it with ``gym.make``.
