The Box2D Environments
======================

These are environments that use the `pybox2d <https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d>`__ game physics library. The version of ``pybox2d`` on ``pypi`` is currently broken (as of July 7, 2017). So you should follow their `instructions <https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/blob/master/INSTALL.md>`__ for building it from source (or use anaconda).

Bi-Pedal Walker
---------------

The `BipedalWalker-v2 <https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/>`__ environment is one in which you attempt to have a bipedal robot walk from one end of the screen to the other (left to right). Unfortunately there's no docstrings so you'll have to look at the source to figure it out. There is also a `BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2 <https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2/>`__ which is similar to the ``BipedalWalker`` but it has obstacles to overcome (ladders, stumps, steps).
